# Deep-Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN-feature-extraction-using-Pytorch

## Project Overview

This GitHub project focuses on implementing a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) feature extraction, multinomial logistic regression, and Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve. The assignment utilizes PyTorch, Numpy, and Matplotlib for implementation. The key tasks include:

1. **Deep CNN Feature Extraction (Question 1):**
   - **Objective:** Extract features from the MNIST dataset using the ResNet-50 architecture.
   - **Implementation:** Utilize PyTorch for feature extraction and save the features and corresponding labels to 'mnist_train.mat' and 'mnist_test.mat'.

2. **Multinomial Logistic Regression (Question 2):**
   - **Objective:** Implement multinomial logistic regression using extracted features.
   - **Implementation:** Apply gradient descent and update parameters for training. Evaluate performance using test features.
   - **Parameters:** Batch Size (`BATCH_SIZE`) and Learning Rate (`LR`) can be modified for experimentation.

3. **Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curve (Question 3):**
   - **Objective:** Implement the ROC curve without using built-in functions.
   - **Implementation:** Calculate True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) for visualization.

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have the required packages installed:
   ```
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
   ```

2. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts for each question.

3. Modify `BATCH_SIZE` and `LR` in `logistic_regression.py` if desired.

## Project Structure

- `extract_features.py`: Feature extraction script.
- `mnist_train.mat` and `mnist_test.mat`: Output files from feature extraction.


## Results

- Review the accuracy plot generated by `logistic_regression.py`.
- Examine the ROC curve for the 9th category using `roc_curve.py`.

**Note:** The provided code assumes a working Jupyter environment and the necessary installations.
